# 2048rb - A terminal version of 2048 game

This is a clone of a Python program which was wrote by [Manh Duc Nguyen](https://github.com/manhdcnguyen).

I rewrite this program in Ruby just because I want to improve my coding skill , this project is just for fun.

Thanks to @manhdcnguyen for your idea.

## Description

A whole of this game is in **main.rb** file. You can start game by requiring this file, then add following lines to your source code 
:
```ruby

table = Table::new <size>
table.mainloop

```

* **W** to turn UP
* **S** to turn DOWN
* **A** to turn LEFT
* **D** to turn RIGHT
